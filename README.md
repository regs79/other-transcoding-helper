# Other Transcoding Helper
An interactive script for Don Melton's fantasic [Other Video Transcoding](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding).

## About
I'm a little particular about which audio tracks and subtitles get included when using Other Video Transcoding so I put together this script to streamline the process.

Rather than needing to remember which command line options you require the script will ask you a handful of quick questions and run Other Video Transcoding for you.

Much like Other Video Transcoding the script is opinionated and the default options favour my particular setup using x265 with a Nvidia GPU.

The script also defaults the bitrate to the highest allowed by Other Video Transcoding as I think the bitrate automatically set is a little aggressive, particulary if the media is 4K.

## Requirements
